# KRS Template – Brown Roofing Remix

This directory contains a modified version of the Klaus Roofing Systems template. The PHP files rely on a CMS to inject dynamic content.

## Files
- `borders.php` – main page wrapper including dynamic open/closed banner code
- `inline.css` and `template.css` – styles for the site

## Usage Tips
1. Upload the PHP and CSS files to your CMS template directory.
2. Update company information, phone numbers and image paths in `borders.php` as needed.
3. Customize the styles in the CSS files for colors, fonts and layout.
