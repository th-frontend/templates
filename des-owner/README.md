# DES Owner Hero Snippet

This small template contains a simple `index.html` and `style.css` used for a hero section promoting home comfort services.

## Files
- `index.html` – markup for the hero banner with a ZIP form and benefit list
- `style.css` – basic styling for the hero, using `screenshot.png` as the background image
- `screenshot.png` – example background graphic

## Usage
1. Replace the text in `index.html` with your company name and messaging.
2. Swap out `screenshot.png` or adjust the CSS background URL to match your own image.
3. Include these files in your website or CMS template where you want a hero call‑out.
