# CT PHP Template

`borders.php` provides a PHP border file used by our CMS for pages related to concrete and foundation services. The file lists page names and modules that should use the template.

## Key Points
- Update the arrays near the top of `borders.php` to match the pages in your site (`$fullpage`, `$noHeader`, `$modulepages`).
- Customize any hard-coded URLs or image paths for your company.
- Use the `customCityPage` section to override specific city landing pages if needed.

Place this file in your template directory within the CMS and adjust styles or includes as required.
